## Note to self and anyone that may read through this

This app is still a WIP as of this commit. Have been working on this offline and decided to add it to the portfolio while continuing the work on it to give me a sense of ownership and show what I am currently doing.

As such, there are multiple "notes to self" within the code that I use to remind myself of future improvements, things to work on, etc. From now on I will try to use the Github features to assign bugs to myself as a way of learning how Github works and to ensure I am following a more sensible approach to this work.

## Motivation

The motivation for this program is because I enjoy games and I enjoy F1. I watched a Youtuber play different online guessing games that have a similar game structure and wanted to create one that I would enjoy.

It is also the perfect way to find motivation in an early project when learning the ropes and once I have finished the main code (still ongoing at time of writing) I will then look to host the app online.

This will give me a good insight into an entire app's lifecycle (albeit only a small personal version) and introduce me to the idea of "full stack" development and means I can easily share the finished product with friends who may be interested in playing it - I feel that seeing someone use something I have created will be a really important milestone.
